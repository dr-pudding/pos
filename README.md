# puddingOS
A NixOS flake containing an all-in-one OS and desktop environment setup for Hyprland. These are basically just my dotfiles that I made public because it makes working with flakes a bit easier. Everything here is currently a work in progress as I am migrating from the old non-flakes system.

## Installation
You will need a working installation of NixOS if you do not have one already. Please see the [NixOS Installation Guide](https://nixos.wiki/wiki/NixOS_Installation_Guide) if you need help. Just make sure your installation has:

- A primary user with sudo access.
- A temporary internet connection.
    - The easiest solution is to use ethernet or USB tethering with a device connected to WiFi.
